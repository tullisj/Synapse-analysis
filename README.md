# Synapse-analysis
Analysis programs to use in imagej
This program is made for use in 3 or 4 color fluorescent images with >= 1 timepoint. The goal of this program is to rapidly detect dually-innervated spines through a object-object distance calculation. Additionally, in 4 color images, the last channel can be used to monitor the synaptic enrichment of a fluorescently-labelled protein of interest.
